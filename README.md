# QR-Code-Generator


A simple command-line tool built with Node.js to instantly generate a QR code from a user-provided URL. The tool saves the QR code as a PNG image and logs the URL into a text file.

Features
Interactive URL Input: Uses inquirer to prompt the user for a URL in the command line.

QR Code Generation: Employs qr-image to create a QR code image from the given URL.

URL Logging: Saves the entered URL to a URL.txt file for future reference using Node.js's native fs module.
